# Windows (G)vimrc

This is a vimrc and colour scheme which works well for me on PortableApps gVimPortable on Windows.

`$HOME` = `gVimPortable/Data/settings`

Place `_vimrc` at `$HOME`

Place `gruvbox.vim` at `$HOME/vimfiles/colors/`

Place `GVimPortable.ini` at `$HOME/../../`, i.e. the directory containing the GVimPortable executable
